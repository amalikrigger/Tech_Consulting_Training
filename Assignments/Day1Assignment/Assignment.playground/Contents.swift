// Interview Questions (Theory)

// 1. How to create mutable and immutable types in Swift?
//  - You can create mutable types in swift by using the "var" keyword and immutable types by using the "let" keyword.

// 2. What is Type Safety?
//  - Type Safety means that once a variable is created as one type, it can not be changed or set to values of a different type. So if the variable is a String, you can not pass it an Int later.

// 3. What is they Inference
// 4. How to create explict and implict variables
// 5. What is Optionals
// 6. how to do optioanl binding
// 7. Diff b/w if let and guard let
// 8 . What is nil coalsing operator


// 9. what is protocol
// 10. What is class
// 11. Diff b/w Struct and Class

// 12. Diff b/w array , dict  Set

        Question(
            question: "How to create mutable and immutable types in Swift?",
            answer: "You can create mutable types in swift by using the \"var\" keyword and immutable types by using the \"let\" keyword."
        ),
        Question(
            question: "What is Type Safety?",
            answer: "Type Safety means that once a variable is created as one type, it can not be changed or set to values of a different type. So if the variable is a String, you can not pass it an Int later."
        ),
        Question(
            question: "What is Type Inference?",
            answer: "Type Inference is the ability for the Swift compiler to identify what the type of the variable is automatically based on the value you provide. let x = 0 (will default to an Int)"
        ),
        Question(
            question: "How to create explicit and implicit variables?",
            answer: "You can create an implicit variable by using the var or let keyword and not specifying the type (var x = 0). You can create an explicit variable by using the var or let keyword and specify the type (let x:String = \"Cat\")."
        ),
        Question(
            question: "What is Optionals?",
            answer: "Optionals are variables that can be nil/null."
        ),
        Question(
            question: "How to do optional binding",
            answer: "You can do optional binding by using an \"if let\", \"guard let\", or \"nil coalescer\". \n" +
            "\n if let name = variableName {\n" +
            "    print(name)\n" +
            " }"  +
            "\n\n" +
            " guard let name = variableName else {\n" +
            "    return\n" +
            " }"
        ),
        Question(
            question: "Diff b/w if let and guard let",
            answer: "An \"if let\" is mainly used to unwrap an optional value if it exists. A \"guard let\" is used to exit the code early if the value does not exist. It tries to ensure that the value exists and if it doesn't it exits. It must utilize the \"return\" keyword to exit the code."
        ),
        Question(
            question: "What is nil coalescing operator",
            answer: "Nil coalescing unwraps the optional variable if it has a value, or it defaults to a value if it is nil. The \"??\" operator is used."
        ),
        Question(
            question: "What is a protocol?",
            answer: "A protocol serves as a blueprint of methods and properties for a class for example to abide by. The class must implement each property and method that the protocol defines."
        ),
        Question(
            question: "What is a class?",
            answer: "A class is a blueprint for an object. It consists of properties and methods."
        ),
        Question(
            question: "Diff b/w Struct and Class?",
            answer: "A Class is a reference type and a Struct is a value type. Classes are stored in Heap Memory and Structs are stored in Stack Memory."
        ),
        Question(
            question: "Diff b/w Array, Dict, and  Set?",
            answer: "Arrays are ordered and Dictionaries and Sets are not. A Set can not have duplicate values. Dictionaries utilize key value pairs while Arrays and Sets use indexes."
